# TeensyLighthouseIMU

This is the arduino code that is uploaded to the Teensy. It implements the Vive Lighthouse system as well as an IMU system to provide positional information through serial.

## How to Upload Arduino Code to a Teensy
* This code was written for the [**Teensy 3.2**](https://www.pjrc.com/store/teensy32.html)
* There is a Teensy plug-in for the Arduino IDE called [Teensyduino](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/teensyduino.html)
* Follow the instruction in the above link to download and install the Teensyduino
* If you don't have the Arduino IDE, you can download it [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/main/software) 

## Notes
- Remember to **CHECK THE PINS** for Photodiodes and for IMUs
- Remember that the IMU SCL and SDA pins need to connect to Teensy pins 19 and 18
